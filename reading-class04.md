## Java OO (Objects and Classes)

### Explain the difference between an object and a class.
- #### Objects:
  are instance of classes, its the main role in object-oriented-programminG (OOP) ,like the actual things you work with in a program, such as a student or a car. objects consists of two main things ( data and methods that manipulate these data).
- #### Classes:
  are bluprint or templates for creating objects, they define the structure and behavior that objects of that class will have. classes mainly for organizing the code and gathering the realted data with each other.

  ### Name two types of state that a Student object might have.?
- #### Name: Represented as a string.
- #### Age: Represented as an integer

### Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have.?
- #### Study: Simulates student studying.
- #### AttendClass: Represents student attending a class.

## Java Classes

### Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.?
the constructor is very important for any programming language , it have alot of functionality such as :
#### Initializes object's state during creation.
#### Ensures valid and consistent initial state.

### Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student”

public class Student {
     Fields and methods will be added here
}

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
### What is the value of the binary number 1101?
Value of Binary Number 1101: Equivalent to decimal 13.
### Write the number 52 in binary. Write it in hexidecimal.
Write Decimal Number 52 in Binary: 110100.
Write Decimal Number 52 in Hexadecimal: 34.

## Things I want to know more about:
1. #### Inheritance and Polymorphism:
   Learn how classes can inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes, and how polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

2. #### Abstract Classes and Interfaces:
   Explore abstract classes and interfaces, which define contracts for subclasses to fulfill, allowing for better code design and multiple inheritance through interfaces.
