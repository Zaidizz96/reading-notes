# OAuth Overview

This README provides an overview of OAuth and summarizes the key points covered in a related tutorial.

## OAuth in Simple Terms

OAuth is an essential protocol for securing access to user data or actions on another service or platform. It allows your application to interact with external services without requiring users to share their login credentials. Here's what OAuth can do for your application:

1. **Secure Access**: Your app can securely access user data or perform actions on their behalf without knowing their login credentials.

2. **User Consent**: Users must grant explicit permission, ensuring they maintain control over their data.

3. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Implement SSO for a seamless login experience across multiple services.

4. **Enhanced Security**: OAuth relies on tokens and permissions, reducing the risk of storing user credentials.

5. **Scalability**: Your app can integrate with various authentication providers for broader user support.

## Authentication Providers

The tutorial covers specific authentication providers, but the exact ones depend on the tutorial content. Common providers include:
