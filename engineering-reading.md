# Engineering Readings 

## Q1: What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I bring a special mix of creativity and logical thinking to my Java programming journey. This means I can come up with better solutions to hard problems while making sure my code stays efficient and high-quality. This skill helps me stand out and benefits both my career and potential employers.

## Q2: What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. ### Teamwork for Problem-Solving:
   When I'm stuck on a hard part of code, I'll reach out to friends or online communities for help. its will give me ideas of the problem

2. ### Doing Research:
   If I'm having trouble with a complex concept, I'll spend time reading up on it. I'll look at guides, articles, and tutorials to better understand the problem and find ways to solve it.

3. ### Taking It Step by Step:
   Instead of trying to   solve everything at once, I'll break the problem into smaller pieces. This way, I can work on one thing at a time.
