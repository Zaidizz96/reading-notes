## Many to Many Relationships

### Examples
- Many-to-many relationships are common in real life, such as:
    - Students enrolling in multiple courses, and courses having multiple students.
    - Authors writing multiple books, and books having multiple authors.
    - Actors appearing in multiple movies, and movies featuring multiple actors.

### Join Table Significance
- A join table helps manage these relationships efficiently without repeating data.
- Think of it as a bridge between two connected things, making it easy to find relationships and keep data organized.

### Values in Join Table
- In the join table, you'll find IDs from both connected things.
- For instance, in the student-course relationship, it would contain student IDs and course IDs, showing who's in which class.
