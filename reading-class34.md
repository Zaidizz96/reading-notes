## Google Play Store App Release

### How Releases and Versioning Connect

Releases and versioning are closely linked. A "release" is when a specific version of the software becomes available. "Versioning" assigns unique identifiers to different states of the software. For example, version 1.0 might be the initial release, and subsequent updates might be 1.1, 1.2, and so on. Versioning helps track changes and communicate the software's evolution.

### 5 Steps to Prepare Your App for Google Play Store

1. **Testing:** Ensure the app works well and fix any issues.
2. **Versioning:** Update the version number to reflect changes made.
3. **Prepare Artifacts:** Create necessary files and assets for release.
4. **Configure Settings:** Set up audience, countries, pricing, and metadata.
5. **Submission and Review:** Submit the app for review by the store.

These steps are essential for a successful release on the Google Play Store.
