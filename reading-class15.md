# Spring Security Reading Material

## Overview

This README provides concise explanations for the questions related to the provided reading material on Spring Security.

### What does it mean to authenticate a user?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically by confirming their provided credentials (e.g., username and password). It ensures that the user is who they claim to be.

### What does it mean to authorize a user?

Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access once they have been authenticated. It involves checking permissions and rights to grant or deny access to specific functionalities or data.

### What are the three possible outcomes of the AuthenticationManagerâ€™s authenticate() method?

The `AuthenticationManager` in Spring Security can have three possible outcomes:

1. **Successful Authentication:** If the user's provided credentials are valid, and they are authenticated successfully, this outcome indicates that the user is who they claim to be.

2. **Failed Authentication:** If the user's credentials are invalid or authentication fails for some other reason (e.g., account locked), this outcome indicates that the user's identity could not be verified.

3. **Exception:** In some cases, an exception may be thrown during the authentication process, indicating an unexpected issue or error.

These concepts are fundamental in the realm of security and access control within Spring applications. For more detailed information, please refer to the provided reading material.
