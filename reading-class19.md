# Functional Programming Basics

---

## Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

No, in functional programming, once you create a data structure, you can't change it. You make new data structures with the changes you want instead.

## What is purely functional programming?

Purely functional programming is a style of programming where you:
- Avoid changing data after it's created.
- Make sure functions always produce the same results for the same inputs.
- Stay away from actions that affect the world outside the program.

## How does purely functional programming differ from your previous programs?

In your earlier programs, you might have:
- Changed data directly.
- Had functions with different results for the same inputs.
- Done actions that affect things outside the program directly.

In purely functional programming, you'll do things differently:
- You won't change data; you'll make new data.
- Your functions will always give the same results for the same inputs.
- You'll avoid actions that affect the outside world directly.
