## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice.
- Learning how to deliberately practice is important for people studying programming and web development. It helps us get better at these skills by pushing us to learn more and try harder things.
+ Think about learning a new instrument, like a guitar. At first, you learn basic chords and songs. But to get really good, you practice the tough parts over and over.
In programming and web development, it's similar. You start with easy things, but to become an expert.
